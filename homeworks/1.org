Homework 1: reading CSV data into R

The goal of this coding project is to get you up and running with R,
including
- downloading data files
- installing packages
- reading CSV data into R as a data table
- printing a summary of the number of rows/columns in a data tablex

Your goal is to write an R script that performs the following steps:

1. use an download.file function to programmatically download a copy
   of the zip.test data set from
   https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/zip.test.gz
   (inside of if statement so that the download only happens if the
   file does not yet exist on your system). Make sure the saved file
   has the gz suffix, which is recognized by fread, and indicates that
   the file has been compressed using gzip. This data file represents
   images of handwritten digits, one example per line/row. Each
   example is one of the ten possible digits (as indicated by the
   label in the first column).
2. use data.table::fread to read the compressed CSV data file into R
   as a data table. 
3. Convert the data table to a numeric matrix, which is a more useful
   data structure for clustering algorithms. Make sure to exclude the
   label column (that is the first column).
4. Use utils::str to print a compact representation of the structure
   of your numeric matrix. What is the number of
   rows/observations/example digits? What is the number of
   columns/features/pixels per example?

For your homework please upload in bblearn a text file with your code,
the corresponding results/output (after running your R code), and your
commentary/interpretation (number of rows/columns in the data set).

(no additional advanced exercises for CS599 graduate students in this
homework)
