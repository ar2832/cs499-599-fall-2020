Homework 2: data visualization using ggplot2

These are exercises from
http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/animint2-manual/Ch02-ggplot2.html
(the variable name viz.aligned below refers to ggplot code on that web
page). 

FAQ

- The web page shows examples using the animint2 package on CRAN,
  which is my fork of ggplot2 that adds interactivity (but the static
  ggplot API is the same in both packages). But animint2 is not on
  CRAN, so to do the homework you need to either (1) use
  remotes::install_github("tdhock/animint2") to download/install
  animint2, or (2) use install.packages("gapminder") to get a
  different copy of the gapminder / WorldBank data set to use with
  ggplot2.

1. In viz.aligned we showed a ggplot with a scatterplot panel on the
   left and a time series panel on the right. Make another version of
   the data visualization with the time series panel on the left and
   the scatterplot panel on the right. Hint: the order of panels in
   ggplots is controlled by the factor levels of the facet
   variable. For example facet_grid(. ~ x) means use the different
   values of the x variable in different facets, where x =
   factor(values, levels).
2. In viz.aligned the scatterplot displays fertility rate and life
   expectancy, but the time series displays only fertility rate. Make
   another version of the data visualization that shows both time
   series. There should be only one ggplot that looks something like
   [[http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/WorldBank-facets/][this]]. Hint: add another geom_point and use both horizontal and
   vertical panels in facet_grid(row_var ~ col_var).
3. Create a multi-panel data visualization (scatterplot of data for
   one year in each panel) that shows each year of the WorldBank data
   set in a separate panel of one ggplot. Hint: use facet_wrap.

Exercise for CS599 graduate students: create an R function that takes
a data table as input, and returns one of the ggplots described in the
exercises above. Read [[https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R/][Creating Functions]] for more information about
how to write R functions -- you will need to do that in your R package
coding projects.

Please submit a PDF with your source code and the resulting three
figures.
